Co-worked with Zach Quinn & Wenting Zhang, supervised by Researcher Dr. Ries.

EllipticalOrbitVersion2:
User will be prompted to enter the semi major axis, the eccentricity, the amount of iterations, and the value of mu. The program computes and outputs the value of n and the period.

SNR Program:
User will be prompted to enter the total number of photons (signal) of the image being analyzed. Then the user will be asked for the number of pixels and the total number of photons per pixel from the background. The program computes and outputs the Signal-to-Noise ratio.
